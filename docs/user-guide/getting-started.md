# Getting Started

## Concepts

### Attack Techniques

An *attack technique* is a granular TTP that has *pre-requisites* infrastructure or configuration.
You can see the list of attack techniques supported by Stratus Red Team [here](../attack-techniques/list.md).

### Warm-up Phase

*Warming up* an attack technique means making sure its pre-requisites are met, without detonating it. 
Warm up is a preparation phase, before executing the actual attack.

Behind the scenes, Stratus Red Team transparently uses Terraform to spin up and tear down the pre-requisites of each attack technique.


### Detonation Phase

An attack technique can be *detonated* to execute it against a live environment, for instance against a test AWS account.

### Reverting and Cleaning up an Attack Technique

*Reverting* an attack technique means "cancelling" its detonation, it had a side effect. *Cleaning up* an Attack Technique means nuking all its pre-requisites and making sure no resource is left in your environment.

### State Machine

The diagram below illustrates the different states in which an attack technique can be.

### Example

Let's take an example. The attack technique [Exfiltrate EBS Snapshot through Snapshot Sharing](../../attack-techniques/AWS/aws.exfiltration.ebs-snapshot-shared-with-external-account/) is comprised of two phases:

- Warm-up: Create an EBS volume and a snapshot of it
- Detonation: Share the EBS snapshot with an external AWS account
- Revert: Unshare the EBS snapshot with the external AWS account
- Clean-up: Remove the EBS volume and its snapshot

## Sample Usage

Stratus Red Team is a self-contained Go binary, embedding all the attack techniques it supports emulating.

You can list available attack techniques using:

```bash
stratus list
```

Detonating a specific attack technique is as simple as running:

```bash
stratus detonate aws.exfiltration.ebs-snapshot-shared-with-external-account
```

You will get an output similar to:

```
2022/01/18 22:32:11 Checking your authentication against the AWS API
2022/01/18 22:32:12 Warming up aws.exfiltration.ebs-snapshot-shared-with-external-account
2022/01/18 22:32:12 Initializing Terraform
2022/01/18 22:32:19 Applying Terraform
2022/01/18 22:32:43 Sharing the volume snapshot with an external AWS account ID...
```

You can then clean up any leftovers from the technique, which in this case will remove the EBS volume and EBS snapshot:

```bash
stratus cleanup aws.exfiltration.ebs-snapshot-shared-with-external-account
```

For more information, see [Usage](./usage.md).
