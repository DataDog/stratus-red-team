# Supported Platforms

## AWS

In order to use Stratus Red Team attack techniques against AWS, you need to be authenticated prior to running it. See: [Connecting to your cloud account](https://stratus-red-team.cloud/user-guide/getting-started/#connecting-to-your-cloud-account).
## Future Support for Additional Platforms

We plan to add support for [Kubernetes](https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team/issues/51), and one of [Azure](https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team/issues/52) or [GCP](https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team/issues/53) in the future.
