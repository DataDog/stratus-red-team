# S3 Ransomware through individual file deletion




Platform: AWS

## MITRE ATT&CK Tactics


- Impact

## Description


Simulates S3 ransomware activity that empties a bucket through individual file deletion, then uploads a ransom note.

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Warm-up</span>: 

- Create an S3 bucket, with versioning enabled
- Create a number of files in the bucket, with random content and extensions

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Detonation</span>: 

- List all available objects and their versions in the bucket
- Delete all objects in the bucket one by one, using [DeleteObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObject.html)
- Upload a ransom note to the bucket

Note: The attack does not need to disable versioning, which does not protect against ransomware. This attack removes all versions of the objects in the bucket.

## Instructions

```bash title="Detonate with Stratus Red Team"
stratus detonate aws.impact.s3-ransomware-individual-deletion
```
## Detection


You can detect ransomware activity by identifying abnormal patterns of objects being downloaded or deleted in the bucket. 
In general, this can be done through [CloudTrail S3 data events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-logging-s3-info.html#cloudtrail-object-level-tracking) (<code>DeleteObject</code>, <code>DeleteObjects</code>, <code>GetObject</code>),
[CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/metrics-dimensions.html#s3-request-cloudwatch-metrics) (<code>NumberOfObjects</code>),
or [GuardDuty findings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-active.html) (<code>[Exfiltration:S3/AnomalousBehavior](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-s3.html#exfiltration-s3-anomalousbehavior)</code>, <code>[Impact:S3/AnomalousBehavior.Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-s3.html#impact-s3-anomalousbehavior-delete)</code>).
